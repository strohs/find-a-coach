Find A Coach
==============================================================================
"Find-A-Coach" is a full stack web-application consisting of a Vue3 frontend, Rest API running on top of express.js 
and using MongoDB as the datastore.

The app itself is a proof-of-cocept CRUD application for a fictitious company named Find-A-Coach.  Find-A-Coach is a "people broker"
that connects "coaches" with customers in need of coaching in different technologies, for example, 
javascript or AWS. 

The website lets customers browse a table of available coaches or search for coaches by expertise. 
They can view the coaches details and if they like what they see, they can request coaching by filling out a form 
to contact the coach.

Coaches can then log into the website and see a list of waiting coaching requests.
